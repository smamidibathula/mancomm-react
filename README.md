### Mancomm UI Developer Exercise

The Charts are avilable in 2 locations:
1.  Under the Reports of the Main Menu
2.  Under Numbers in the Overview Page


 Thank you for providing this assessment opportunity. Working on this exercise with MUI and DevExpress was both enjoyable and challenging. I did my best to complete the tasks within the given time frame. I eagerly await any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
